# Pranav's Website
This is the source code for my website ([](https://pranavkonda.com/)). It is not very complex, and has very little backend. 

## Stack
The bulk of the project is in React, using Next as a framework. I use TailwindCSS for styling purposes, and Firebase for integration with a small database for hosting links to images. 
This project is hosted on Vercel.
