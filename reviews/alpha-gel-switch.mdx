# Introduction
As has been the case for the past 3 years, towards the beginning of the school year I bought
this pencil to use as a daily driver. Coming from two of the best pencil lines ever, the 
Alpha Gel and Kuru Toga lines, I had high expectations for this pencil, and it absolutely delivered.

With its easy to use switch mechanism, which can turn on and off the Kuru Toga mode (which rotates the 
lead on each press to make the lead stay sharp, but adds a bouncy feel when writing), which is 
especially helpful when sketching or drawing (looking at you artists and geometry lovers), the
pencil accommodates many preferences while being very comfortable for long writing sessions. 

# Mechanics

## Weight

The pencil is nicely front weighted, allowing for long writing sessions and a balanced 
force when writing paper. It adapts nicely to multiple writing styles, and the front weight
of the pencil works perfectly with the Kuru Toga mechanism. 

## Grip

The grip is a highlight of this pencil, as is common for alpha gels. It's not the squishiest 
alpha gel grip I've used (that honor goes to the Alpha Gel Shaker) but it's squishy enough to where
it's comfortable for regular use. The slight firmness is a plus in my opinion, as excessively 
squishy grips tend to hinder writing after say, 30 minutes of writing time. 

## Body

The body is made of a quality plastic, and is pretty scratch resistant. There's a nice window
for the Kuru Toga rotation indicator (which you can see on the image) which is easy to look at.
The parts feel secure, and the eraser cap stays on firmly. 

## Eraser 

The eraser is rather small (it's a standard Uni size S eraser) and if you erase too much, 
it's hard to get the eraser out and access the lead pipe. The eraser cap is very firm and stays
in place securely though. The eraser is not a strong point for this pencil, but is usable
and doesn't hinder the user experience at all. 

# The Switch mechanism

The switch mechanism allows you to "turn off" the Kuru Toga mode, and have the lead stay 
fixed in place while writing. This immediately changes the feel when you write from light
and bouncy to a very stable one. This is especially helpful when writing on a surface where the 
Kuru Toga mechanism might not work very well, or if you want to sketch something. It's not 
obtrusive either, as you simply rotate the clip of the pencil which acts as a switch. There's a 
small key on the side of the clip, telling you which direction to rotate in, and the clip clicks 
into place once it's reached the other mode. This whole mechanism is well constructed and allows
the pencil to accomodate fans of the Kuru Toga mechanism and those who don't like it as much. 

# Recommendation

Overall, I strongly recommend this pencil, as it's served me extremely well as a daily driver for the past 6 months.
