				<p>Welcome to my personal site and blog! To learn more about me, you can go to the About Me page. To learn more about what this site aims to do, you can read on below!</p>

				<p>This site can be split into three main sections: Writing, Tech, and Resources. These three words sum up what I wanted to do with this site pretty well: have a place where I can publish writing, have a place to talk about tech and projects, and to have a place to put all the resources I've created for many different things over time that is easily accessible. </p>

					<p>The <b>Writing</b> section of this site contains the Blog, Ratings, and Suggest pages (you can see the group on the footer below). Most of that should be self-explanatory, but the ratings page might not be so straightforward. I have a lot of things which I'd like to tell you about, and some of those things are about books, products, series, or other items that I think deserve a rating (mostly stationery, since I'm a huge stationery fan!). You should visit the page itself to learn more. </p>

					<p>The <b>Tech</b> section of this site contains the Website, Projects, and Configs pages. The website page is all about this website: how it was made, set up, and runs, and any maintenance or development changes that I think are noteworthy to mention. You could think of it as a changelog. The projects page is about projects: things that I've decided to program or implement on my own rather than using an existing solution. Maybe there are no solutions already, or the ones that currently exist don't satisfy my needs. Everything you'd want to know about these projects would be found there. Lastly, the configs section. People often ask me about what my "setup" is for a certain thing, so I've decided to make a page detailing all of that and how to set them up. </p>

					<p>Lastly, the <b>Resources</b> section. This contains the Handouts, Lectures, and Guides pages. The former two are pretty self explanatory, but the guides section has some specific topics! A lot of these guides will be about either tech related subjects or science/math related subjects. </p>
