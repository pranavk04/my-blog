Choosing an operating system is a big decision, because it defines how you will interact with your computer. 
Most of the time, you are shipped a computer that has Windows on it by default. 

Windows works, but it doesn't work very well. It's pretty resource heavy (bye-bye RAM!) so it won't play well
with old hardware. If you're a developer or program on a semi-regular basis, Windows just sucks. It's also 
pretty restrictive, since it's a proprietary operating system, which means you don't have smart people making 
cool things on it as easily. 

Enter (to no one's surprise...) Linux, which solves all of those problems. Except there are hundreds of
different flavors of Linux (distros) so it can get confusing. But at least they all use the same kernel (the 
layer between your OS and your hardware). For a beginner, I'd recommend Linux Mint over the traditional
recommendation of Ubuntu. 

I wholehartedly recommend Linux over Windows because it's faster, uses much less resources, and is open-source!
This means you absolutely get smart people making really cool things that you can use. 

One of the "essentials" that I've gotten used to is having a tiling window manager which 
automatically sizes and snaps my windows into place when I open new ones. Or everything just being more 
terminal-oriented. I really like using the terminal, it's a lot faster than clicking (assuming you can type
reasonably well), and Linux is really kind to terminal users. 

On my desktop, I like to use Arch Linux, which is a more barebones version of Linux that requires you to 
figure things out for yourself. It's rather time consuming, which is a disadvantage, but it allows you
to choose what you want to install and forces you to know what you're doing and installing. 

Arch in particular has a very comprehensive wiki which it's famous for, and a large repository of 
packages (both official and "unofficial") so you can basically install whatever you want with `pacman`, the
package manager. Which is the best package manager ever by the way. It's blazing fast and really featureful!

Also, the Windows API is pretty bad to work with. I've tried it before, but the amount of pandering you 
have to do for legacy systems (think 16-bit) is really tiring. I like Microsoft's commitment to 
backward compatibility, but if you're writing an application for a modern user, including code fragments
for an operating system from 15 years ago isn't going to help anyone. 

The traditional argument of "what about my games?" has also fallen to the wayside recently. With the advent of 
proton, gaming on Linux has gotten *really* good. Like to the point where it outperforms Windows sometimes and 
matches it the rest of the time. Aside from a few games with really invasive anticheating software (looking at
you, Valorant[^1]), proton has gotten really good. 

Of course, you can't completely escape Windows. For instance, the drawing software I use, Clip Studio Paint, 
doesn't have a Linux port. Similarly, industry CAD software (cough cough Solidworks) is notably absent from 
Linux too. 

But that's okay, because you can always install Windows on a separate partition (like I do) and have it run 
there for when you need it. Or end up using it more often because you got tired of having to configure 
Arch. (￣ー￣；

However, you might have noticed at this point that one OS is notably absent. Yes, MacOS exists too!
Ironically, I use OSX more often than Windows and Linux at this point, because my laptop is a 
MacBook Pro. MacOS is based on BSD, which is a Unix derivative. This means a lot of shared qualities 
with Linux, if you're willing to walk on the edges of the "walled garden". 

I have a tiling window manager on my Mac too, `yabai`! It's basically a clone of `bspwm`, down to the 
hotkey manager that you configure it with[^2]. I also have my own top bar widget, like `polybar` you would 
find on Linux. 

Almost all the terminal programs I use regularly also work on MacOS, since I can install the ``gcc`` versions
of core utilities with ``brew`` (Homebrew), the OSX package manager. I like the base look of MacOS, which 
surprisingly plays a nontrivial reason in why I choose to use it on my laptop over a Linux distribution. 
It also just, *works*, which I now value. I don't want to think about configuring all of the laptop-specific
things on Arch (made worse by the T2 chip[^3]), and as the old adage goes: "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

But hey, you could watch anime in your terminal on any one of the three OSes we talked about today, so
does it really matter in the end?[^4]

Perhaps not.

[^1]: I learned recently that Valorant's anticheat software actually taps into the Windows kernel
and basically gains full access to the user's entire computer. While I too think cheating in videogames
is a problem (the first time I played Hypixel Bedwars, the enemy team could *fly*!), that's a bit 
excessive in my opinion. 

[^2]: These window managers represent windows as leaves of a binary tree, so you basically can 
the avaiable space in half each time you open a new window, and then that window is considered its 
own "space", because when you open *another* window while that one is focused, they both become
children of some parent (in not graph theory speak, the space of the original window is split in 
half again).

[^3]: Apple has some encryption shenanigans that makes some hardware not accessible if a proper OSX
bootup hasn't occurred, so installing Linux on a modern MacBook is inherently incomplete. Could always
use a VM though. 

[^4]: If I've peaked your interest with this, check out ``ani-cli``! It scrapes gogoanime.tv and pipes
the stream output to `mpv`, which is a very good video player. No ads, no clicking with the mouse, 
just open a terminal and go!
