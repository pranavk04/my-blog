Motivation is essential to achimevent and accomplishment. Whether it's your motivation to finish your 
homework so you can work on more fulfilling things, or the enjoyment you gain from those fulfilling 
things, motivation underlies almost all of our decisions, aspirations, and goals. But at the same time, 
a lack of motivation can cause someone to feel directionless or detest what from their point of view, are
being forced to do. 

There are two types of motivators: extrinsic motivators and intrisic motivators. 
Extrinsic motivators are ones like validation from peers, qualification for 
special opportunities or the winning of awards, or the big one for parents, 
"this will look good for college applications!" Intrinsic motivators are the 
ones that are often harder to justify from a time-cost standpoint: personal 
enjoyment, fulfillment, and curiosity. There are two wildly different 
perspectives on motivation as well: "You're spending all this time doing 
this, but what will you have to show for it?", which implies that extrinsic
motivators matter more than intrinsic ones, and the one I've seen more amongst 
people who've reached a high level in certain subjects: that contests and "glory" 
don't really matter anymore, and it's your love for the subject that really matters. 

And both are valid. Sometimes, you need to know when to quit, and recognize when something
might be cool but is completely not worth your time in the long run. And other times, 
recognizing that competition isn't everything is important, as the moment you take away the 
competitive aspect of something[^1], your entire motivation for pursuing something is gone. 

Motivation is also a highly dynamic construct. As you learn more about a subject, 
your motivations tend to change. Some people discover that they don't like what 
something becomes[^2]. There's also the classic story of doing something just because your parents or your 
peers did it, and discovering over time that you like it for its own merits. Your 
motivation might change from day to day, or stay constant across your career and lifetime. 

In my experience, motivation tends to be rather fragile and highly oscillatory. I tend 
to jump around between different ambitions quite often[^3] and my motivation for pursuing one area
will often be eroded by a growing interest in another field. It's oscillatory in the sense 
that I will eventually return to the previous area, but the period is irregular. 

I'm also in the position where most external motivators have disappeared. I've already 
finished applying to college, and this is my last year being eligible for any olympiads that 
actually matter for something like college applications or have high stakes. This year has been a testament 
to how much I enjoy things, such as Science Olympiad[^4], and also has me questioning my motivations for other 
things. It's a slight hedonism, in that I'm free to do things that I choose[^5].

But it's this freedom of choice that makes me question things. Do I let myself finally
have a break after spending the last three and a half years *grinding* to get myself to this 
position? Or do I continue on, because of some arbitrary attachment to what I've been doing 
since I was 13? Do I adopt the path of least resistance, or keep grinding for motivations
that are too abstract to phrase properly? It's a peculiar crossroads to be in, and one that
my perspective on changes quite frequently, to the point where it's like I'm in a stasis of sorts. 
Perhaps this is senioritis rearing its head. 

Oh how I can't wait for summer...

[^1]: Consider the plight of olympiad competitors who are now in college: they don't really have competitions with the same breadth and stakes anymore. 

[^2]: This was my experience with partial differential equations, and differential equations in general. On the surface, they seem riveting, with their 
immense applicability and uses. But once I delved into them and their theory, I found it to be just a motley bag of tricks: memorizing solution methods.
I'm sure it gets better later on (I've seen some differential geometry books with sections on differential equations), but for the moment I've been put off by them. 

[^3]: The creation of this website was exactly like this. I started in the summer of 2021, and randomly remembered it existed as a project and briefly updated it until now, 
where I've really come to finish it up. 

[^4]: Science Olympiad's team aspect makes it hundreds of times more enjoyable! I really like the sense of unity and community it brings me, and the fun of 
socializing at tournaments and the like. It and robotics have been my big "team" activities, and the intense moments of joy I've had through them were very worth it. 

[^5]: Alas, schoolwork prevents me from having a completely free lifestyle at this point. But June is almost here!
