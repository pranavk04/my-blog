title: 'Math'
summary: "Helpful books that I've read while studying math."

Learning math can be a challenging time. After all, it's one of the
most profound and rich subjects in the universe, with so many different
fields and pedagogical approaches. This is my attempt to (and serves as
a reference for me) to offer some suggestions. 

I'm very much interested in combinatorics and algebra, and this
list is probably going to skew heavily toward that (sorry).

 - **Abstract Algebra**: *Abstract Algebra*, by Dummit & Foote. Jam packed with
    content. Will serve as an invaluable reference but is very readable.
    Also covers a huge swath of content and goes into commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and a bit of categories.
 - **Commutative Algebra**: Eisenbud. Lots of exposition (which I like
    personally) and has a nice guide on how to use the book. Can also
    look at Atiyah-MacDonald, which has really good exercises and 
    is really short. 
 - **Algebraic Geometry**: Haven't read too much of these but Kriz & Kriz is pretty good (and relatively new) and covers all the Commutative
 Algebra you need as you go along. Hartshorne is a standard reference. Also Ravi Vakil's the Rising Sea.  
 - **Algebraic Number Theory**: Jarvis. Lightweight book but very 
    readable and covers a good amount of content. 
 - **Analytic Number Theory**: *Multiplicative Number Theory*, by Montgomery and Vaughan. Goes through all the standard content with good exercises and clear proofs. Has more exposition than the "classics" like Serre. Also the problem book by Murty. 
 - **Category Theory**: *Category Theory in Context*, by Emily Riehl. 
 - **Complex Analysis**: Freitag and Busam. Super good book, great
 exercises. Some tiny translation errors from the original German text. But really good book. Has a volume two as well!
 - **Differentiable Manifolds**: Tu. 400 pages of good content. 
 Approachable after Analysis and Topology.
 After that you can look at *Smooth Manifolds* by Lee. 
 - **Enumerative Combinatorics**: Stanley. Volume one especially I think everyone should try and read at some point. Packed full of 
 problems (like over a hundred per chapter [granted, there are only four chapters]). Covers a lot of algebraic combinatorics too. 
 - **Graph Theory**: Bollobas. Has so much cool content, so good reference too. 
 - **Linear Algebra**: Hoffman and Kunze. Very abstract flavoring, but is also kind of old. Has some really nice content though (pair with Dummit and Foote to hone in the tensor algebra stuff).
 - **Matroid Theory**: Welsh. This is what I used to study some. It's really cheap too as it's a Dover publication.
 - **Polyhedral Geometry**: *Lectures on Polytopes*, by Ziegler. Has 
 a lot of pretty diagrams and is written in a really casual style
 which makes reading it fun. This subject itself is really fun. Must read.
 - **Probability Theory**: Klenke. A huge tome but well written. Lacks many exercises though. Doesn't require measure theory beforehand: the first few chapters of the book develop the necessary theory. 
 - **Real Analysis**: Pugh. Good exercises, clear exposition (so not dry like a certain "classic") and goes through content past multivariate analysis. 
 - **Topology**: Munkres. Classic text. Covers a lot and is well written. Has many exercises. 
 - **Algebraic Topology**: Hatcher. Doesn't deal too much with categories though, but great text to learn algebraic topology. For a more fancy flavoring you can look at Rotman, which deals extensively with category theory. 

As a bonus, here's some good CS books too: 
 - **Algorithms**: CLRS. Really good reference and feels 
 so nice in the hand. For someone with a good grounding in 
 math it is a great place for TCS.
 - **Combinatorial Optimization**: Papadimitrou. Clear descriptions
 and pseudo-code demonstrations. Fun subject too.
 - **Classical Machine Learning**: Shaylev-Schwarz. Very mathematical
 treatment that shys away from no rigor. Covers everything you'd need
 too.
 - **Neural Networks**: Aggarwal. Good exercises, and nice exposition 
 with some cool connections. Covers modern topics like CGNNs (graph 
 neural networks).
