	<p class="text-center">Hi there, I'm Pranav! I'm currently an undergraduate at Columbia University.</p>

	<p>
	If I were to provide just the essence of my interests, I am (very
	broadly) interested in structures and their inner machinations. While this may not seem obvious at first, 
	a deeper look into everything stated below will ultimately return to this fundamental concept. But for slightly more context,
	as the great mathematician Hermann Weyl once said, "Besides language and music, mathematics is one of the primary manifestations of the free creative power of the human mind."
	</p>

	<p>
	In particular, I am deeply intruigued by the following (you can click for the specifics): 
	</p>
	<ul class='list-disc space-y-2 m-4 ml-8'>
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/math">Mathematics:</a> 
algebraic structures and their natural realizations in topological and geometric contexts.</li>
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/linguistics">Linguistics:</a>, comparative analyses and historical 
			linguistics, with an aim towards the interaction of culture and language.</li>
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/language-and-religion">Eastern languages and religion:</a> the study of 
		classical Sanskrit and Tĕlugu literature, Veda (and ritualism), Vedāṅga, Sūtra, and Śāstra corpora. I am also interested in the study of classical Chinese and Japanese, the development of Buddhism, and the exchange of philosophy between India and East Asia.</li>
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/carnatic">Carnatic music:</a> I have been studying the Carnatic flute (veṇu) since I was a child.</li>	
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/computing">Computing:</a> computational complexity, convex optimization, and quantum computing (along with an obligatory mention of machine learning).</li>
		<li><a class="underline text-primary-500" href="/about/shakuhachi">Shakuhachi:</a> I also play the shakuhachi, the end-blown Japanese flute originating from the suizen practices of komusō monks.</li>
	</ul>

	I also enjoy Gong Fu tea, story-driven games, Pokémon, hardware, stationery (fountain pens and paper), the starry night sky, and making new friends!
