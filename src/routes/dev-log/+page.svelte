    <p class="text-gray-700 text-center">A log of this website's maintenance and development.</p>

    <p>This website is written with a combination of Svelte and TailwindCSS. It uses MDSveX to render Markdown into blog posts, but no other packages, for very few dependencies.</p>

        <ul class="m-4 list-disc">
            <li> Font and UI changes. More unnecessary pages have been removed, a better font (EB Garamond) was chosen to accurately represent all characters. Heading font was updated to a Fraktur script because I find it very appealing from ring theory. 
            </li>
            <li>Updated the About page to better reflect my current interests and pursuits. Also updated the projects page, to add my work done since it was last updated.</li>

            <li>Updating some now outdated content, and adding some new projects I've done in the
meantime.

        <ul class="m-4 list-disc">
            <li>Completely revamped the internals, switching to Svelte, as the 
                old React code had broken in a large NextJS change, and Svelte (in my opinion) is a better framework.
            </li>
            <li>Completely redid the UI, focusing on a cleaner, more minimalist look with style.</li>
            <li>Purged a lot of unnecessary pages, and redid some of the page organization.</li>

            <li>Redid my About Me, and the Recommendations page.</li>
            <li>Added the Nature page for my photos.</li>
            <li>Added a footer with a link to the source repository.</li>

        <ul class=" m-4 list-disc">
            <li>I revamped the site's UI completely, shifting from the obtuse navigation bar at the top to the side nav with icons.
                I kept the concept of the top bar, but removed the links and have just kept my GitHub and Discord icons there. </li>
            <li>I also started adding more pages, and cleaning up the unfinished ones.</li>
