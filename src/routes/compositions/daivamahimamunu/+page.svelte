    <div class="space-y-4">
        <p>I'd like to prefix the analysis of this composition with the remark that (much like the contention in the Carnatic community over the tyāgarāju kr̥ti "saṅgīta jñānamu") that from a purely artistic and musical perspective, there is no need to bring religious sentiment onto the stage as long as one is conscious of the composer's intention and takes that into account when delivering a "bhāva-filled" performance. My inspiration was more toward the function of composition as a devotional and religious medium, and within that framework, the meaning of the sāhitya is as intended.</p>

        <p>This kr̥ti came to me while I was walking in Riverside park while the sun set, because I randomly felt like walking in the park that day. I had a taṁbuṟa playing in my ear. I was particularly reflective that day on many things, and the sāhitya began to come out. The rāga bhairavi with its grand and reflective nature only accents the message of this kr̥ti. Here's a rough translation:</p>

        <div class="text-center">
            <p>For those that do not acknowledge the majesty of the divine, what is the use of musical knowledge?</p>
            <p>No matter how much they sing, do they get any fruit from it? Answer me, O mind!</p>
            <p>Those who falsely ask to be protected while disingenuously harboring lies in their hearts</p>
            <p>do they truly understand the greatness of sāhitya?</p>
            <p>However, that true devotees, upon hearing the pure 7 svara-s, </p>
            <p>will truly shine, is certainly known to this Veṅkaṭapraṇava.</p>
        </div>

        <p>On some level, this is a reflection of those who pretend to be superior to others due to their use of religiously-oriented musical sentiments in their singing while not doing so for a proper purpose within. Falsely asking to be protected while singing the sāhitya of a song, when they do not truly acknowledge the sentiment of the lyrics is meaningless. There is no benefit to be gained from haughtily pretending to be superior in one's religiousness to others. However, those that truly understand the intricacies and respect the others around them will shine when listening to and singing the 7 svara-s.</p>

        <p>This is the only purely ādhyātmika kr̥ti I've composed to this point. It is a reflection upon the current climate within the Carnatic community as well as a reflection upon disingenuity. While it is fine to not know out of not being taught, it is not fine to pretend to know when your internal motivation is only to improve your outward appearance relative to others. Arrogance has no place on the musical stage, whether it be to simply perform or for genuine upāsana.</p>
