## Operating System
I have a 16" MacBook Pro from 2019, with an i9 and 16 GB of RAM. I use MacOS on it, although kind of modified. 

On my desktop (i7 6700k, GTX 1070, 16 GB of DDR4 2133 Mhz), I used to use both Arch Linux and Windows, but I currently 
use just Windows due to storage issues (most of my files were on Windows anyway) since I have a small drive, and because
I got tired of trying to configure Arch endlessly. 

This is much more insignificant, but I prefer Android phones, as iOS still doesn't have a filesystem or other essentials. 
I do have an iPad however, so I can and will beat you at iMessage pool. Hmph. 

## Core Programs
I use Firefox as my web browser, since it's lightweight, plays nicely with Linux, is open source, and saves me a ton of 
battery on my laptop. Also, it doesn't monopolize my RAM, and the logo looks cooler. 

For my terminal emulator, I use `kitty`, because it supports ligatures (pretty fonts and symbols!) and image previews and
a host of other things. Also the logo looks cooler than other terminal emulators (this is becoming a pattern). I like the 
mononoki nerd font, patched with powerline, for my font of choice. It's my default font in most places. 

I use `yabai` and `skhd` and their counterparts `bspwm` and `sxhkd` on MacOS and Linu respectively. These tiling window 
managers use binary space partitioning, which I have gotten extremely used to. On Mac, I use an Übersicht widget called
simple-bar as my top status bar, while on Linux I like to use polybar. 

I like to put docks on the left side of the screen instead of at the bottom, since I'm left handed. 

For text editing, I like NeoVim. I have tried Emacs before, but realized I just want a text editor, not a Lisp-interpreter
turned OS replacement. Vim integrates better with terminal-based workflows anyways. This is how I program most of the time. 
Except for web development, like this website. I use VSCode for web development, since it has better tooling and I don't
mind the extra heft for this one use case. I enable Vim mode, since I can't live without it nowadays. 

I use `zathura` to view PDFs. Or Skim, if I'm on a MacBook and I need fast background refresh.[^1]

On my computer, I use Clip Studio Paint for drawing, but I also have Inkscape since it supports ``svg`` to ``tex`` which 
I use somewhat frequently. I have Procreate on my tablet. 

I use a terminal email client, `aerc`. It doesn't store your mail locally like other clients, and supports multiple accounts
and all those cool features. Except email threading, but I don't work in a large corporation and haven't had a problem 
with that very often. Full HTML emails on the other hand... why not just use plaintext? It lets me edit emails with Vim, which 
is not something I knew I needed until now. 

I use ``ani-cli`` to watch anime from my terminal instead of going onto the web, since it's faster and I can watch 
in `mpv`, which is a much better client than the web streaming video players. 

I play games on my Windows desktop, my Switch, or on my PS5. I also like playing Pokémon, so I use my 3DS from 
time to time, which I installed Homebrew on, or my Game Boy Advance. I also like playing old games on my computer through emulators, and 
Pokémon ROM hacks. 

[^1]: On Linux, `zathura` is faster at background refreshing, but for some reason, the Mac implementation is horribly slow 
at background refreshing. I use Skim instead, since it's also pretty light.
