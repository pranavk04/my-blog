# Introduction
LaTeX is an essential thing to learn if you're going to be writing anything related to math,
which is a very broad spectrum of things. Of course there's math itself, but also physics, 
chemistry, biology, and the like. There's also the raw power of LaTeX as a document processor.
Once you've learned LaTeX though, you might wonder how to use it quickly and 
effectively to do something like take notes in class. 

Over the past 3 years, I've been using LaTeX to take notes in higher level math classes while
sitting in lectures, and it's actually quite an effective setup if done properly. While 
typing speed is probably the biggest limiting factor, having some of the following tools
can really boost your speed at LaTeX and make taking beautiful notes a reality and not a dream!

With that being said, let's dive into the details.

## The Editor 
Obviously, you need something to type your code in. And while online LaTeX editors do exist, 
such as Overleaf, these are not ideal for speed. The fastest way to edit LaTeX is going to be 
on your own machine, preferrably with a lightweight text editor. I use `vim` to accomplish
this task, with a few plugins. 

With its modal editing, vim is perfect for getting things done quickly. There are wonderful
plugins, specifically vim LaTeX suite, which make vim an ideal place to do everything 
LaTeX related. 

With simple *macros* that expand into full LaTeX commands (which also happen to be called macros), 
such as ``i` expanding to `\int_{<++>}^{<++>}`, the plugin is a really efficient way to 
type while someone is explaining live. 

Combining this with `coc.nvim` for linting and autocomplete makes a really smooth experience, 
as it uses the TeXLab language server to deliver fast linting and command completion. It's 
also really lightweight. 

## Compiler
While it's not *really* a compiler, `latexmk` is a script which I use to call the compiler for 
my LaTeX code. It's smart about compiling things in an efficient manner, and even provides the 
option for a live preview of your work! Simply call the `-pvc` option when inputting the command
in your terminal to have it autorefresh your pdf in the background. You need to use the `-pdf` flag
to actually compile to a pdf though, since the default is `djvu` like most LaTeX compilation systems. 

Using a pdf viewer that's compatilble with background refreshes is also important. I'd recommend 
using Skim if you're on a MacBook, `zathura` if you're on Linux (this is my favorite pdf viewer, 
as it has vim like keybinds!!), and SumatraPDF for Windows. 

## Class file
I have my own class file, `yozora.cls` (so named because I have environment themeing meant to look like 
the night sky, or 夜空), which contains a lot of custom macros for longer commands
that I use, just to make things even easier on me. I have a couple common ones, like `\RR` for 
`\mathbb R`, but also ones that I have to type a lot for my classes. I also have a couple document 
styling parameters set, like the font and page margins. 

## Workflow
Typically I'll begin by opening 2 sessions of my terminal, one for vim and one for latexmk. Once 
it starts up, the pdf file preview pops up (sizing this is easy because I have a tiling window manager)
and I write LaTeX code while I'm in my lecture. I always write my changes to see the preview once I've 
finished coding a "piece" of the problem at hand or the theorem on the board. This allows me to catch any 
errors and also grasp the concept better by seeing it in my own framework. 

## Shortcomings and Wrapping Up
The biggest issue I have at the moment is diagrams. and while I've seen some setups for this before, 
I don't think diagrams are something I really need to do while I'm in a lecture, as I'm not taking any
pure geometry classes! 

Overall, I think that having a locally installed and *tailored* LaTeX setup is going to beat an online 
platform every time, both for ease of use and speed. While being able to collaborate is useful (and what
I think should be the intended use of online platforms), nothing beats having the ability to write 
LaTeX when your wifi is down!
